Weather analysis to determine the profitability of a Surf Shop.

# Overview of Analysis
I looked through SQLite data provided in by my business partner W. Avy to get an idea of how the weather was on Oahu in December and June. W. Avy wants to confirm that the weather during these months would sustain business at his Surf/Ice Cream shot. My findings are below, I took a look at average temperatures and temperature spread for the month of June and December for the whole Island and more specifically data recieved from weather station (USC00519281).
# Results

-December temperatures might be a little on the cool side for ice cream.  The average temperature was 71 degrees. With the majority of the month hovering between 69 and 74 degrees.

#Summary

December seems like a less then ideal start to the season for the shop. It might be a good time to schedule vacation for W. Avy

-December on average was 3 degrees colder then June.
-December's high temperature was also 3 degrees lower then June.
-December also had a much lower minimum temperature and a larger standard deviation meaning it most likely has less predictable temperature and may make it difficult to anticipate business levels.

Other factors that should be considered in this analysis are average precipitation and average day light.  It is likely that December may have less hours of light and would limit the amount of time the shop could be open.  Conversely if June is warmer, but rainier, it could also create challenges to viablility of the shop.
