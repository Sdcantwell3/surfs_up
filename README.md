# surfs_up
Weather analysis to determine the profitability of a Surf Shop.

# Overview of Analysis
I looked through SQLite data provided in by my business partner W. Avy to get an idea of how the weather was on Oahu in December and June. W. Avy wants to confirm that the weather during these months would sustain business at his Surf/Ice Cream shot. My findings are below, I took a look at average temperatures and temperature spread for the month of June and December for the whole Island and more specifically data recieved from weather station (USC00519281).
